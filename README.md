# Music-Streaming-Subscriptions-Churn-Predictor

## Overview
This project involves developing a supervised machine learning model to predict customer churn for PlaylistPro, a music streaming service. The goal is to identify customers at risk of cancelling their subscriptions so that targeted strategies can be implemented to retain them.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn using their subscription information and listening habits. By accurately predicting churn, PlaylistPro can offer incentives like price reductions to retain at-risk customers.

## Tasks
This project includes the following key tasks:

1. **Model Development**
   - Build a classification model using a training dataset of 12,500 customers. The dataset includes details on subscription information and listening habits, and whether the customer has churned.

2. **Model Testing and Validation**
   - Use the trained model to predict churn on a test dataset of 2,500 customers.
   - Submit predictions to Kaggle to receive an official accuracy score.

3. **Presentation of Findings**
   - Answer the following questions in a Kaggle notebook:
     - Can we reliably predict which customers will churn using your model?
     - How does your model work? (Discuss algorithms and features used)
     - What percentage of the 2,500 customers in the testing dataset do you expect PlaylistPro will retain?

## Project Goals
The project aims to understand customer behavior deeply and use this understanding to reduce churn rates, thus improving PlaylistPro's business sustainability and customer satisfaction.
